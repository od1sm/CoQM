<!-- ABOUT THE REPOSITORY -->

## About the repository

This repository contains the programs that were written to solve the project assigned to us during the 2022-2023 class. For Computational QM, each student was required to choose two problems and do a presentation on them. For Quantum Information, we had to recreate some research plots. That's why this repository is divided into two sections, which includes the code as well as some notes on the results. These notes could be either a derivation or an analysis of the problem at hand.

The majority of them are written in Python and make use of well-known packages such as NumPy (arrays, matrix manipulation), Matplotlib (plotting) and Numba (optimized machine code).

<!-- ABOUT THE QM CLASS -->

## About Computational QM and Application class

The course introduces students to the fundamental computational methods for solving quantum physics problems.
The listings chosen were compared to Computational Problems for Physics by "Rubin H Landau & Manuel J Paez".

<!-- ABOUT THE QUANTUM INFORMATION CLASS -->

## About Quantum Information class

This course introduces students to the theory and practice of quantum computation. The following topics were covered:
Information theory, quantum logic, quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, quantum communication, and key distribution.
